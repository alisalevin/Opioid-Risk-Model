Modeling the Opioid Crisis

This project's aim was to investigate the spread and severity of the opioid crisis in certain areas, as well as look into any external societal factors that may play a role in influencing the extent to which the opioid crisis plagues a given region. Specifically, we sought to create visualizations for the spread within 5 states (Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia), determine which socioeconomic characteristics were most relevant in predicting susceptibility to the opioid crisis in a given county, and design a mathematical model that could use these factors to predict how likely a county was to undergo the crisis or not.

We set about reaching these goals by adding several key features to the original data set from other online databases, identifying what counties were affected most by the crisis in 2016 via the total number of drug usage reports, and determining the socioeconomic factors from 2012–2016 most correlated to these counties. We then used these, along with a training set of most affected counties of each state in 2016 to design a model that, given a set of correlated social factors, calculates a predictive score from 0–1 that indicates whether a county will likely be affected by the opioid crisis or not. We tested our model on test sets of the second-most affected counties of each state in 2016 as well in 2017.

Our model was able to successfully compute likelihood scores for our test set on par with the scores of our training set. On both the 2016 and 2017 test sets, 100% of affected counties received likelihood scores of 0.60 or above from our model, and 79% of these scores were 0.90 or greater. Furthermore, for the least affected counties in both test sets, our model generated likelihood scores of less than 0.5. Thus, our model correctly identified counties that were most likely to be affected by the opioid crisis (with a likelihood of 0.6 and above), and counties that were unlikely to be affected by the opioid crisis (with a likelihood of below 0.5). The results of this model painted a similar picture of the opioid crisis as the original data from 2016 and 2017 alike, showing that it can both generalize and extrapolate to the future.
